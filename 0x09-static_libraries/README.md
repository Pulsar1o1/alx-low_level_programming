0x09 - Static Libraries

Project Overview

This project is designed to enhance your understanding of static libraries in the C programming language. Through practical tasks, you will gain insights into creating, utilizing, and comprehending the purpose of static libraries.

Learning Objectives
Throughout this project, you will achieve the following learning goals:

Static Libraries: You will grasp the concept of static libraries and how they operate.

Library Creation: You will learn how to create your own static libraries, encapsulating C functions.

Library Utilization: Understand the process of integrating static libraries into your C programs for modular and efficient code organization.

Essential Tools: Become familiar with key tools such as ar, ranlib, and nm that are fundamental for working with static libraries.

Project Tasks
The project encompasses two essential tasks:

Library Creation (Task 0): In this task, you will create a static library named libmy.a, housing various C functions. Additionally, you will provide an example program that demonstrates how to effectively use this library.

Script for Static Library (Task 1): You will craft a bash script, create_static_lib.sh, designed to compile all .c files within the current directory into a static library labeled liball.a.
