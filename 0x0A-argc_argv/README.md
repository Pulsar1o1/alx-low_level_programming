Project: 0x0A - argc, argv
Project Overview
This project delves into the utilization of command line arguments in C programs. Through practical tasks, you will explore various aspects of handling command line inputs and learn how to tackle unused variables.

Learning Objectives
Throughout this project, you will gain insights into the following:

Command Line Arguments: You will understand how to work with arguments passed to your program when executing it from the command line.

Main Function Prototypes: You'll be able to distinguish between the two main function prototypes of main and know when to use each.

Handling Unused Variables: Learn the techniques for handling and compiling functions with unused variables or parameters, such as __attribute__((unused)) or (void).

Project Tasks
The project encompasses several tasks that aim to reinforce your knowledge:

Program Name Printer (Task 0): Develop a program that prints its name, adapting to changes in the program's filename without recompilation.

Argument Counter (Task 1): Create a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.

Argument Printer (Task 2): Build a program that prints all the arguments it receives, with each argument on a new line.

Number Multiplier (Task 3): Write a program to multiply two numbers, handling various scenarios and error conditions.

Coin Change Counter (Advanced Task 5): Develop a program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a specified amount of money.
